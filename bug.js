While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error related to the Expo CLI. When attempting to run the app on an Android emulator, I received an error message indicating a problem with the Android build process, despite the project seemingly having the correct configurations. The error message was vague and didn't point to a specific cause.  The error message was inconsistent. Sometimes it would complain about missing dependencies, other times about a build system failure. The project's package.json and app.json files appeared correct; I had also tried cleaning the cache and restarting the development server multiple times.

// bugSolution.js
// This file doesn't contain code to fix the bug directly, but rather outlines the steps to debug the issue.

// 1. Check Android SDK Setup:
//   - Ensure ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME are correctly set in your environment variables.
//   - Verify the Android SDK is properly installed and updated.
// 2. Clean the Build:
//   - Run `expo prebuild --clean` in your terminal.
// 3. Update Expo and Dependencies:
//   - Run `expo upgrade` to update the Expo CLI.
//   - Run `expo install` or `npm install` to update project dependencies.
// 4. Check for Conflicting Dependencies:
//   - Carefully review your `package.json` file to identify potential conflicts.
// 5. Rebuild the Project from Scratch:
//   - Delete the `node_modules` folder.
//   - Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to reinstall dependencies.
//   - Run `expo prebuild` to generate a clean build.
// 6. Examine the Log Carefully:
//   - Pay close attention to any warning or error message within the Expo build log.
//   - Look for clues and more information in the logs that may have been missed previously.
// 7. Test on a Physical Device:
//   - Connect an Android device and attempt the build. This may isolate whether the issue is emulator-specific.
